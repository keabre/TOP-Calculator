# Project Plan

## Guidance steps provided by The Odin Project

1. Your calculator is going to contain functions for all of the basic math operators you typically find on calculators, so start by creating functions for the following items: (add, subtract, multiply, divide)

2. A calculator operation will consist of a number, an operator, and another number

3. Create a new function 'operate' that takes an operator and 2 numbers and then calls one of the above functions on the numbers

4. Create a basic HTML calculator with buttons for each digit, each of the above functions and an “Equals” key. There should also be a display for the calculator and a 'clear' button.

5. Create the functions that populate the display when you click the number buttons.

6. Make the calculator work!

7. Extras: 
    - Your calculator should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time
    - You should round answers with long decimals so that they don’t overflow the screen
    - Pressing “clear” should wipe out any existing data. Make sure the user is really starting fresh after pressing “clear”
    - Display a snarky error message if the user tries to divide by 0… and don’t let it crash your calculator!
